      <p>
        Something feels off. The lights flicker. The room's too quiet. And that one team? They're too calm.
        <br><br>
        Welcome to <strong>Take DeBait 6.0</strong> — a murderous concoction of debating, deception, and deduction. This isn't your average MUN. This is a courtroom without rules, a game where words cut deeper than blades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every round, someone bleeds. Metaphorically (probably). You're not just debating — you're surviving. Your tongue is your dagger, your logic is your alibi. Slip up, and you're the next victim. Or worse... the imposter.
